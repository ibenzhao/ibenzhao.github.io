            <p>Prompt: "What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement
                your subject matter?"</p>
            <p>Response:My plan for project 1 is to create an modern and energetic website base on the electronic dance music festival. My clients are focusing on the teenagers and music players. For my design, I want to play around with the transperency
                and show something like the tik top style. For the image, I would choose iconic like the portland city’s skyline or portland bridge to connect the Oregon EDM festival.The typeface and color should be simplify bright and more compelling
                to the branding.</p>

            <h2>Week Three</h2>
            <p>Prompt:When we design, we are telling a story. We tell it through visuals, through content, and through the paths we lead our viewers on. When we can imagine a viewer to tell our story to, it can make for a stronger design. It helps us focus
                on crafting our story. This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from
                you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv.
                what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
            <p>Response:My client I hope to be someon who likes fashion and could be someone who doesen't have confidence, I hope they would feel better after they listen or watch the the music I shared. This could be the teenager who has stress like me,
                that person should be cool!</p>

            <p>Response:I think my project goes not very well because I missed the image size and quality of the website, also I have to adjust allitle more about the font style and place. I think it woule more connected with EDM music. One thing I like
                my project is the effect of the slides, and the color scheme</p>

            <p>Prompt: Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What
                bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
            <p>Response:I think the best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. It means I want my second project would be simple and clean. So I can avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language I use on labels, also when we deliver the
                message. The second project should feel more comfortable and are able to get things done more quickly. The overall layouts and designs throughout the site should help facilitate efficiency.</p>

            <p>Read this article on mobile-first design and share your thoughts on mobile-first vs desktop first. https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00</p>
            <p>Response:People Having been the only choice for a long time, ‘desktop-first’, and it has been the traditional approach to designing websites. Even after the rise of mobile devices, there are plenty of situations in which this more clear and
                detailed method remains ideal. I personally think that mobile function is more reliable and more specific to the audience.</p>

            <h2>Week Nine</h2>
            <p>Prompt: What are the most important features of a good portfolio site? How can you showcase the work without upstaging it? Did you find any sites that used color in a convincing way? What kinds of interactions did you see? What about branding?
                In what ways is the work you do and who you are a commodity?</p>
            <p>Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article.</p>
            <p>Response:The reason why I pursuing a career in design because I love creativity and innovation. My oldest brother started out in graphic design when he was young, he especially loves typography and illustrations. When I was little I used to
                sit for hours and hours and watch my brother work on his college art projects. I just loved watching how he created the beautiful animations and wanted to learn how I could do it by myself too. So this makes me fall in love with graphic
                design and not just want to follow my brother's steps. I always compare my design and the other's. I have been trying hard for every single project, but when my project turned out not very well. I would question or judge myself abilities
                and skills, it makes me really want to give up on graphic design. I think I should have more confidence and never be afraid to fail, keep trying, I will succeed.</p>
